Container Labs is a **DevOps practice** project designed to set up and manage multiple server environments using Docker containers and networks, along with monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDevOpsHub/container-labs.git
cd container-labs
```

## Labs

We devided this repo into 3 main areas:

[**pools**](./pools/)

- Contains the base infrastructure for each tool and server. For example: `ubuntu-vm`, `grafana`, `prometheus`, ...

[**src**](./src/)

- Contains source code, script for configuration and infrastructure as code approach. E.g: Ansible/Terraform

[**labs**](./labs/)
Contains various labs with different architectural combinations. These labs combine components from the [**pools**](./pools/) directory and utilize code from the [**src**](./src/) directory to provide hands-on architectural setups.
